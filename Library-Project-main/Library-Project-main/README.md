# Library-Project
A project developed in the Java programming language, using object-oriented concepts, data structures and MySQL data persistence with JDBC.

*To run it, download and open it in an IDE of your choice. It will be necessary to have a MySQL application running with the databases with the scripts created in the project (for consistency tests). You will need to run with 'jdk-8u301-windows-x64'. You will also need to apply the MySQL client to the project to recognize the commands (it will also be in a folder in the project).*
